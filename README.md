# Odin Recipes

This project is a basic recipe website created as part of The Odin Project. It showcases my understanding of HTML and my ability to build a structured web page with links to various recipes.

## Project Features

- A main index page that links to several recipe pages.
- Each recipe page contains:
  - An image of the dish
  - A description of the recipe
  - An ingredients list
  - Step-by-step instructions

## Technologies Used

- HTML

## Future Improvements

- Include more recipes.
- Optimize images for faster loading.
